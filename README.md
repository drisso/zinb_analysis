# Data analysis and simulations for the ZINB-WaVE paper

This repository is designed to allow interested people to reproduce the results and figures of the paper:

Risso D, Perraudeau F, Gribkova S, Dudoit S, Vert JP. ZINB-WaVE: A general and flexible method for signal extraction from single-cell RNA-seq data. bioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/125112

### A note on `zinbwave` version

To exactly reproduce the analyses of the paper, version `0.1.1` of the `zinbwave` package is required. This can be installed in R with the following code.

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("drisso/zinbwave@v0.1.1")
```

The `zinbwave` packages is under active development and we are constantly fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving the documentation, hence we recommend to download the latest stable release (currently `0.1.4`) for all purposes other than exactly reproducing the analyses of our paper. To do so, use the following code.

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("drisso/zinbwave@v0.1.4")
```

## Getting started

### Real data

For each of the real datasets analyzed in the paper, there are a `.Rmd` file and a `.R` file in the `real_data` folder, e.g.,
for the Patel data, the files are [patel_covariates.Rmd](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/real_data/patel_covariates.Rmd)
and [patel_plots.R](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/real_data/patel_plots.R).

One needs to compile the .Rmd file first. This will have two effects: (i) it will create an HTML report with useful analyses of
the dataset; and (ii) it will create a `.rda` file with the results of `zinbwave`, `pca`, and `zifa`. Once this file is generated,
one can use the `.R` file to generate the dataset-specific plots found in the paper.

To generate the plots related to silhouette width, one needs to source the [silhouette.R](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/real_data/silhouette.R)
file.

To generate the plots related to the goodness-of-fit, run the `.Rmd` files in the `real_data` folder starting with `goodness_of_fit`, e.g., for the Patel data, the file is [goodness_of_fit_patel.Rmd](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/real_data/goodness_of_fit_patel.Rmd).

### Simulations

To create the simulated datasets from the real datasets used in the paper, first run the code in [simFunction.R](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/sims/figures/simFunction.R). Then, run the `.R` files in the folders in `sims/figures`. Finally, run [figuresPaper.Rmd](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/sims/figures/figuresPaper.Rmd).

To simulate the datasets from the Lun & Marioni model, run [lunSim.R](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/sims/figures/fig6e-g/lunSim.R). It uses file [function.rds](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/sims/figures/fig6e-g/function.rds) generated by the steps described in the Methods section of the paper. Then, run [fitZinbLun.R](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/sims/figures/fig6e-g/fitZinbLun.R).

To fit the simulated datasets with n=10,000 cells, we used a [Makefile](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/sims/figures/fig6ad-S13-S14/Makefile) to launch jobs on a server. Alternatively, you can just call [fitZinb10000.R](https://github.com/drisso/zinb_analysis/blob/master/sims/figures/fig6ad-S13-S14/fitZinb10000.R) from your terminal with the arguments you want.
